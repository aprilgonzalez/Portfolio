<p>Reflection:The concepts between Python and Scratch are similiar but the way they are produced is different.</p>
<p>Reflection: A list is is a tool that can be used to store multiple pieces of information at once. I thinnk all the groups worked becasue everyone is really helpful and collaborative.<p>
